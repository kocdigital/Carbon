# Getting Started with Carbon Framework

## What is Carbon?
Carbon is a back-end framework developed by [KoçDigital](https://www.kocdigital.com/en-us/home). 
The main purpose of this framework is to simplify and standardize development. 

With rapidly developing technologies, the technology stack of companies is growing; Carbon helps developers for these technologies by providing some methods and guide.

> Carbon offers extension methods for common packages, not wraps them!

## Why Should I Use Carbon?
When a developer starts a new project, there are some basics to do. But every developer can add these basics differently.
And maybe some new developers may have trouble doing them. Or when developer needs to use technologies like ElasticSearch or Redis, the implementation should be same for every developer, otherwise readability of code drops, pull requests becomes harder to apply. Carbon helps to solve those problems.

## Where Can I Get Packages?
Use [Nuget]() for packages.

## Is There a Documentation For Packages?
We offer a [sample project](https://github.com/kocdigital/Carbon.Sample) and an [API documentation](https://kocdigital.github.io/Carbon). Feel free to use them and if there is a problem contact us from [discussions section](https://github.com/kocdigital/Carbon/discussions)

And if needed, there is [this](https://kocdigital.github.io/Carbon/articles/_getting_started.html) quick example about how to create sample web api using carbon.
