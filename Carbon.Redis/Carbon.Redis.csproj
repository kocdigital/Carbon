     <Description>2.6.0-preview
Enabling pub/sub is now optional, defaults to false
HashRemove and HashCounter supports added

2.5.0-preview
Multiple Sentinel and Redis Cluster support
More accurate healthcheck for any kind of server installation (Cluster, Sentinel, Basic)
StackExchange.Redis upgrade

2.4.0-preview
More extension methods added (Get a key from redis, if null set it via method and return)

2.3.0-preview
Numerous type of handy extension methods are added such as Hash, HashAsObject, Set
Use HashAsObject to store a complete object into hash fields for boosted performance (Only supports Json serialization), and able to get selected fields rather than the entire object
Use Set for relationships or etc.

2.1.3-preview
Carbon.Redis JSON binary serializer added on the top of binary formatter serializer which is unsupported as of dotnet 5. Simply use static method ICarbonCacheExtensions.SetSerializationType as desired serialization type which defaults to binaryformatter.

If you try to get binaryformatter serialized keys via json binary serializer from redis, you will receive default value (such as null). At that moment, remove the existing key, and add the new one with the new serializer, or use set to replace it.

System.Text.Json (faster) is used as master serializer/deserializer replacing Newtonsoft.Json. This may require to add [Serializable] tag over your objects, make sure you consider it!

2.0.0-preview
  Enables you to use CarbonRedisCache Helper in your services to access more extended methods and capabilities (i.e. RedLock, Redis PubSub etc.) and make the legacy apis compatible with this package
  Handle with care while using this Helper extension methods as it contains binaryformatters which are obsoleted as of dotnet 5, either allow this feature in your csproj or do not use dotnet 5 and greater
  BinaryFormatters will migrate to JsonSerializers or other serializations at incoming versions
1.3.3

1.2.0
	Added health check.
1.0.9
- Redis Key Length Retrieval from Configuration, not from Redis as a Key
1.0.4
- Scan Keys And Remove By Pattern</Description>
