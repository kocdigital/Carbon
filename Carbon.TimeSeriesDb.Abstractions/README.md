This package brings timeserie database specific abstractions and a base package for [Carbon.TimeScaleDb.EntityFrameworkCore](../Carbon.TimeScaleDb.EntityFrameworkCore/README.md) 
Using this package as stand-alone is not *recommended*. Please use the mentioned one in order to enable more capabilities and numerous type of operations set.

Any other timeserie databases other than TimeScaleDb will be introduced by implementing this abstraction library.
